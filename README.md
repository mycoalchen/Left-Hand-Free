# Left-Hand-Free

I originally made this when I wanted to use an Apple Magic keyboard with my Windows PC, but I've since found it helpful for its pure convenience. It lets me use media functions without taking my eyes off the screen to look at the F-keys, and most of these shortcuts can easily be done with just the right hand.

## Shortcuts:

Right alt + Backspace -> Delete key

Command + Shift + A -> Screenshot


Right alt + Left -> Previous track

Right alt + Right -> Skip track

Right alt + Up -> Increase volume

Right alt + Down -> Decrease volume

Right alt + M -> Mute

Right alt + Space -> Pause
